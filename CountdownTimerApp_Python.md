# Countdown Timer Application

## Overview
This is a simple countdown timer application built using Python's Tkinter library. The application allows you to set a countdown time and provides controls to start, pause, and stop the timer.

## Features
- **Start Timer**: Begin a countdown from a user-specified time.
- **Pause Timer**: Temporarily pause the countdown.
- **Stop Timer**: Stop the countdown and reset the display.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Tkinter (usually included with standard Python installations)

## Installation

## Usage
1. Navigate to the project directory.
2. Run the script using Python:
   ```bash

   ```
3. Enter the countdown time in seconds in the input field.
4. Use the "Start", "Pause", and "Stop" buttons to control the timer.

## How It Works
- Enter the desired time in seconds, then press "Start" to begin the countdown.
- The "Pause" button will pause the timer, allowing you to resume it later.
